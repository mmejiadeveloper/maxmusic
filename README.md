# How to run

Fist run `npm install` to get everything set up

Then create a `.env` file in the root of the project containing the apikey variable this way `REACT_APP_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx`

Finally run `npm start` so it gets running

That's it

### Dependencies

Just `react-router`

* Node version 20.5.1
* Npm version 9.8.0

### Notes

Im glad you wanted to have an extra look to the repo, I didnt add new code for sure, have a look to the commits.
Just wanted to let you know a few things that I forget to bring here:

* Responsiveness was not considered, this was developer in a 1980 x 1080 resolution, so if you run this in a smaller or larger screen consider to zoom in or zoom out accordingly.
* Implemented style tries to mimic the design sent over the PDF that Terminal provided me, it is just a normal style, no fancy looking.
